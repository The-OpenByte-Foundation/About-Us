# About-Us
What is The OpenByte Foundation?

We are a group of people that want to change the world one small step at a time. We currently don't know how were going to be changing this world, but something will come up and we will. 
If you're a new member, welcome. If you want to be a member, please contact our team at contactofficialthelastguest@gmail.com. We'd like to know why you'd want to join us.
None of us get paid, if you were wanting to know. 


Our current members are:
Raj Singh
